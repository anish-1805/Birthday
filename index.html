                        didn't know what to do. So I just kept quietly watching you, hoping that one day I'd have the
                        courage to say hello.

                        and I loved listening to it all. The way you sat beside me, the way your hand touched mine,
                        and the way you smiled at my silly jokes made my whole world feel more beautiful. My heart
                        started to melt the moment you began putting your clip on my collar it felt like you were
                        quietly marking me as yours.

                        After all those lovely talks, I finally gathered all my courage to ask you to come out with me.
                        I still remember how we were both so conscious that no one from the office should see us
                        together. The moment we sat in the auto and started moving, we were so happy. We held hands
                        properly for the first time, you leaned on my shoulder, and you felt safe in my arms. I was so
                        excited that even the slightest flick of your hair looked graceful to me. We sat, we ate, we
                        talked, and for me everything around us just stopped. Then that little moment came when I tied
                        your shoelaces and it wasn't just a shoelace, it was me tying a promise that I will love you
                        forever and ever. And then, like in a fairytale, the princess kissed her prince.

                        When my cutie beauty pageant went to the Nykaa event as an influencer, I felt so incredibly
                        proud of you, my princess. You were so, so, so happy that you got to meet your fans! You
                        didn't want to go at first, but I insisted, and it turned out to be such a graceful moment
                        in your life. You looked super pretty with your earrings on, absolutely stunning. The way you
                        explained everything to me with such cuteness and excitement—what happened, the gifts you
                        received, every little detail—I loved listening to it all. And when you told me that you
                        missed me there, my heart just melted. That moment took me away completely.

                        From the very first moment I saw you in the office, I knew you were someone special. I was too 
                        afraid to talk to you, but destiny had other plans for us. When we finally started talking, you 
                        shared everything with me—every story, every gossip, every little detail of your day—and I fell 
                        deeper in love with you each time. The way you put your clip on my collar, marking me as yours, 
                        that was the moment I knew I was completely yours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our first date will forever be etched in my heart. Holding your hand for the first time, feeling 
                        you lean on my shoulder, tying your shoelaces—it wasn't just a shoelace, it was me tying a promise 
                        to love you forever. And when you kissed me, my princess kissed her prince, and my fairytale became 
                        real.

                    <p>
                        Every movie date, every moment we've spent together, has been magical. Watching you shine at the 
                        Nykaa event as an influencer made me so incredibly proud. You looked absolutely stunning, and the 
                        way you excitedly told me everything that happened, how you missed me there—those words melted my 
                        heart completely.

                        Today, on your special day, I want you to know that you are my everything. You are the most beautiful, 
                        graceful, and amazing person I've ever known. Every flick of your hair, every smile, every word you 
                        speak—everything about you is perfect. You make my world more beautiful just by being in it. You complete me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I promise to always be there for you, to support your dreams, to make you smile, and to love you more 
                        with each passing day. May this birthday bring you all the happiness you deserve, and may all your 
                        dreams come true. I can't wait to create a million more beautiful memories with you.
                    </p>
